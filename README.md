# My Research Portfolio

Hello! My name is Maycon Oliveira, I'm a PhD Student in Genetics from Brazil! I hold
a MsC in Genetics and a Bachelor's in Biological Sciences. I work primarily with
genomics and bioinformatics, but I have a passion for software and web development.

In this portfolio, you will be able to take a look at my past and ongoing projects,
my academic accomplishments, my publications and my curriculum. Feel free to contact
